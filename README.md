# fuckyou.exe
Sonic flips you off, sometimes.

# The idea
Every 20 - 40 minutes, the file will open itself, and will show an image of Sonic flipping you off.
If you try to delete the file, the tabs will pull a "YOU ARE AN IDIOT!!" kind of situation and use up a chunk of RAM with their bouncing-all-over-the-fucking-desktop bs. 

The file will also create 7 files, each one being a Chaos Emerald, and hide them throughout your computer. If you find them all and put them into the fuckyou.exe-main folder, Sonic will turn into Super Sonic, and each time the EXE opens, 2 tabs will show instead of 1. 

# How are you gonna do this? 
No idea.
